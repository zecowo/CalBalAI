# CalBalAI Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: August 7, 2025**

### Our Privacy-First Philosophy

Your privacy is the foundation of CalBalAI. Our core principle is simple: **Your data is yours.** The data you create and track within the app is stored securely on your own devices and synced only to your private iCloud account. **We, the developers of CalBalAI, do not have servers to collect, view, or analyze your personal health data.**

This policy explains what data the app interacts with and how it is handled, always with your privacy as the priority.

### How Your Data is Handled

#### **1. Sign in with Apple**

To securely sync your data across your devices (like your iPhone and Apple Watch), the app uses the "Sign in with Apple" service. This service provides the app with a **unique and anonymous identifier**.

*   We cannot use this identifier to see your name, email, or any other personal information. Its sole purpose is to ensure that the data in your private iCloud account is correctly linked only to your devices.
*   You have the option to share or hide your email address during sign-up, a choice we fully respect.

#### **2. HealthKit Data (Health App)**

CalBalAI is designed to work with Apple's Health app (HealthKit) to provide a seamless experience.

*   The app will ask for your **explicit permission** to read specific health data (like activity, weight, and biometric information). This data is read by the app on your device to perform calculations and display insights. **It is never sent to us.**
*   The app will also ask for your permission to write data (like logged meals and weight entries) to your HealthKit store. This allows you to see your CalBalAI data in the Health app and use it with other applications. This happens entirely on your device.

#### **3. Meal & Weight Logs (SwiftData & iCloud)**

All the meals, weight entries, and goals you create in CalBalAI are stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. If you have iCloud enabled, this data is automatically and securely synced between your devices using **your private iCloud account**. We, the developers, do not have access to your iCloud account or the data stored within it.

#### **4. AI-Powered Meal Analysis (Third-Party Services)**

When you use an AI-powered feature (like analyzing a meal from a photo or text description), the relevant data is sent for processing.

*   The meal image or text description is sent **anonymously** to a third-party AI service provider to generate nutritional information.
*   This data is **not linked to your user identifier** or any other personal information. The AI service processes the content and returns the analysis without knowing who you are.
*   **Photo Privacy:** If you choose to use a photo that contains a face, and your in-app privacy setting is set to "Allow," the app will automatically **obscure the faces by drawing a box over them on your device *before*** the image is sent for analysis. This redaction step ensures that no identifiable facial images leave your device.

### Data Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with any third parties for marketing purposes. The only time data is sent to a third party is for the anonymous AI meal analysis described above, which is essential for the feature to function.

### Children's Privacy

CalBalAI is not intended for use by children, under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
